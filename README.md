## Challenges & Learnings

*   **API Interaction and State Management:** Handling state updates effectively after simulating API calls for adding, editing, and deleting users.

*   **Notification Setup:** Integrated React Toastify for real-time action notifications.

## Future Enhancements

*   **Advanced State Management:** Use Redux, Context API, or Zustand for better scalability.
*   **Improved API Error Handling:** Improve logging and user-friendly error messages.
*   **Enhanced Form Validation:** Integrate a validation library like Yup or Zod.
*   **Backend Integration:** Connect to a backend API and database.
*   **Testing:** Implement unit and integration tests.
*   **UI Component Library:** Use Material UI or Tailwind for enhanced styling.
